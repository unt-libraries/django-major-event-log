About
=====

This Django application is designed to keep track of digital preservation events
using the `PREMIS <http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/schemas.html>`_ Event model.
The app takes care of both creating and viewing these events. The admin site is
responsible for managing the actual events, which includes creating them as well as
making modifications to the event date, contact info, description, etc. The other
pages are responsible for displaying events with various levels of detail.
