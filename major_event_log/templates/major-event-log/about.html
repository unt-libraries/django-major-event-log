    <p>This application serves to document major events related to the UNT Library's digital preservation projects. These events are not tied to specific objects, but rather affect all preserved objects or major subsets of objects.</p>
    <p>The events themselves can be viewed collectively on the home page or viewed individually by clicking on the appropriate event's title. When viewed individually, the event is displayed in plain HTML. If desired, the event can also be displayed using the PREMIS format by clicking on either of the two blue buttons underneath the individual event's details. The 'PREMIS XML' button will show <b>only</b> the PREMIS xml, while the 'ATOM' button will present the PREMIS xml embedded in an ATOM object. Additionally, an ATOM feed is available by clicking the 'Atom Feed' link on the right of the navigation bar, which will always show the 10 most recent events, provided they exist.</p>
