About
--------------------------

This Django application is designed to keep track of major events in the PREMIS
format.  The app takes care of both creating and viewing these events. The
admin site is responsible for managing the actual events, which includes
creating them as well as making modifications to the event date, contact info,
description, etc. The other pages are responsible for displaying events with
various levels of detail.
